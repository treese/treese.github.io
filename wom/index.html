            <h1>Winwheel.js example wheel - wheel of fortune</h1>
            <p>Here is an example of a code-drawn Wheel of Fortune looking wheel which spins to a stop with the prize won alerted to the user.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
                With some additional coding it could be made so that the prize won is added to a total after each spin rather than
                just alerting the prize to make a proper wheel of fortune like game.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Choose a power setting then press the Spin button. You will be alerted to the prize won when the spinning stops.</p>
